We are Clara Alejos and Gonzalo Ortiz, Erasmus students in the course "Parallel Programming For Machine Learning." 
For our midterm project, we chose to parallelize a task like Password Decryption. For the final project, we initially decided to work on Image Stitching, 
but after trying to implement two different approaches, we succeeded with one, but when attempting the second approach, we started facing difficulties. 
Therefore, we decided to switch to another topic, K-Means Clustering, and parallelize that as well.

Best regards.
