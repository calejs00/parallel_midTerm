# panoramas-image-stitching



```
Overview

This project implements image stitching to create panoramic images using Python. The process includes feature detection, matching, homography estimation, warping, and blending. The script is optimized for parallel processing to enhance performance.

Features

Uses OpenCV for image processing and feature matching

Implements homography estimation for accurate stitching

Supports batch processing of images from a folder

Includes visualization for debugging and results evaluation

Usage
